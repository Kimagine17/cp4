Important commands:
-npm install vue-multiselect --save
-npm install axios
-npm install multer

Generic notes:
-Run the above command to have the multiselect drop down
-Review a book selecting a review shows blank in the drop down, not sure why
-The pages are not scrolling, and are blocked by footer :( especially submit a review
-Make the text input area for a review larger
-Make the drop down menu take up more space so title's aren't cut off
-Submit a book is still a menu option? I thought that was changed??

Next Steps:
-Add a genre (under admin page)
-Add a book (under admin page)
-Display books (home page)
-Create book view pages :)
-something I'm totally forgetting


To Do Kim:
npm intall multer
